I created this project as a way for me to learn how github works and also
start learning about/using some different web-development technologies so I
can progress in becoming a more capable programmer. As a programmer, I started
out with learning some C++ years ago in CS classes at school, which I haven't
kept up with at all. I'm somewhat familiar with basic html/css, having worked
some with building websites, mostly in Wordpress. Web-based Augmented Reality
via java-script seems like an interesting (perhaps overly ambitious) place to
start exploring next.
